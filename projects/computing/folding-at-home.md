Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers and scientific researchers. Insights from these data are helping scientists to better understand biology and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics.

Install our software to become a citizen scientist and contribute your compute power to help fight global health threats like COVID19, Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, and cancer. Our software is completely free, easy to install, and safe to use.
