In this project, researchers at the Princess Margaret Cancer Center in Toronto, Canada, are using World Community Grid to analyze a massive amount of data from tissue and blood samples of cancer patients and healthy controls to identify combinations of markers that play a role in the development, progression and treatment of various forms of cancers. Initially, the research will focus on lung and ovarian cancer, followed by prostate, pancreatic and breast cancers. The project is designed to accommodate additional cancers in the future.

Identifying all clinically useful markers would require thousands of patient samples and testing an astronomical number of marker combinations, which would be intractable even on World Community Grid. Instead, the researchers have developed software which uses heuristics (clever steps that reduce the enormous search space by focusing on the most relevant subsets of combinations) to greatly reduce the computational effort required to look for significant marker patterns. Even these software methods require a very large amount of computer processing power. By using World Community Grid, the researchers will use the Mapping Cancer Markers project to break down this overwhelming process into smaller, manageable tasks which can be performed by our volunteers' computing devices. World Community Grid therefore allows researchers to undertake this ambitious research.
