View the project [**here**](https://lhcathome.web.cern.ch/).

What is the Universe made of? How did it start? Physicists at [CERN](http://cern.ch/) are seeking answers, using some of the world's most powerful particle accelerators.

LHC@Home is a volunteer computing platform where you donate idle time on your computer to help physicists compare theory with experiment, in the search for new fundamental particles and answers to questions about the Universe.

Whether it's calibrating searches for particles, fine-tuning the machines and beam dynamics, contributing to building new theories on dark matter, or creating simulations of antimatter and new phenonema never-before seen in the LHC's giant detectors...Whether you choose one or several projects to participate in, your contribution will have a very real impact on which will help us make monumental discoveries about the Universe we live in.
