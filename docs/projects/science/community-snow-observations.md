View the project [**here**](https://communitysnowobs.org/).

This project aims to improve our understanding of snow depth variability in mountainous regions. We need community-based observers, including backcountry professionals and recreationists, to help gather snow observations.

We can cover more ground together, and we need your help! Using the [Mountain Hub](http://mountainhub.com/software/) or the [CitSci](http://citsci.org/) smartphone apps, you can make snow-depth measurements as you travel.

Or, you can record measurements in the field and then submit them from your home computer using [SnowPilot](https://snowpilot.org/).
