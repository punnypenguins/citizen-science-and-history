## Other sources I've pulled from:
- [Society for Science](https://www.societyforscience.org/research-at-home/citizen-science/) - Society for Science is a champion for science, dedicated to expanding scientific literacy, effective STEM education and scientific research.
- [r/CitizenScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitizenScience/) - The subreddit dedicated to citizen science. Small, and not particularly active, but could grow.
- [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/idea/citizen-science-projects/) - This page on their website has several good citizen science projects linked in different subject areas.
- [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience) - They've listed all of their citizen science opportunities in one handy place.
- [CitizenScience.gov](https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/#) - Every single citizen science project from any USA government agency in the country is listed on their website.

(And a special shout out to members of the Saint Louis Genealogical Society's Facebook group who gave me leads on several record projects, Dr. Donovan who taught me more than I can ever thank her for about citizen science and scientific teamwork, and my good old laptop who put up with running Folding@Home like a jet engine the whole time I was putting this repository together.)
