In the past 20 years, only a small number of new drugs designed to treat childhood cancer have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Half of all the chemotherapy treatments used for children with cancer have been in existence for 25 years or longer.

Members of the Smash Childhood Cancer research team have identified proteins and other molecules that play key roles in certain childhood cancers. The challenge is now to find chemical drug candidates that specifically target these key molecules and therefore control the cancer cells. However, finding such drug candidates among millions of possibilities is an expensive and challenging process.

A search on this scale is possible only with the help of World Community Grid volunteers. The effectiveness of these chemical compounds can be tested in millions of virtual chemistry experiments, each performed on volunteersâ€™ computers or Android devices.

These calculations will identify the top drug molecules that are likely to control each of the target molecules found in cancer cells. Laboratory tests will then identify the best compounds from the identified candidates for further research and drug development.
